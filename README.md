		<p align="center">Welcome to my website! My name is Emily Trumble and I am currently enrolled in the UTeach Program at Towson University. I have wanted to be a teacher since 7th grade, when I had a math teacher that took time out of her schedule and involved herself in my education so that I moved up a math course. She inspired me to become a teacher when I was in middle school, and still inspires me to this day. I truly believe that there should be mutual respect between teacher and students in the classroom. In the past when I treat a student with respect instead of treating them condescendingly, they are more motivated to learn. I am so incredibly excited to teach students mathematics in a creative and engaging environment!</p>
